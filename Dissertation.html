		<p>My Honours project involved the exploration of Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) and its use at improving a playerâ€™s enjoyment compared to pre-set difficulty settings in a simple FPS game. 
			  DDA is where a game will change how difficult it is depending on how well a player is preforming. 
			  For example if a player is doing very poorly and dying a lot, the game will recognise this and possibly lower such things as enemy hit rate, health and damage output to make the game easier. 
			  The opposite can also occur when a player is doing very well at the game, if this is the case then the game will become harder and pose a greater challenge. 

		<p> The hypothesis of my dissertation was the use of DDA in an FPS game would make the experience a lot more enjoyable overall as opposed to the user selecting a difficulty setting (Easy, Normal, Hard). 

		<p> As I theorised the experiment was a success, the vast majority of participants that took part significantly enjoyed an application which adjusted how well the player was doing.
