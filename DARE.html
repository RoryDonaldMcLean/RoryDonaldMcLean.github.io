					 <p>MEGACORP was a RTS project that was being developed by a small indie team I was part of called Cybernaut Games. 
					 The team was formed with myself and a few members from our 3rd year group project at Abertay. 
					 The game was focused around owning and controlling a Mega Corporation in a cyberpunk dystopian future, where you fight for control over the planet through hostile take-over, sky networks and scientific superiority. 

					 <p>My key roles as part of Cybernaut Games was gameplay designer and a programmer. 
						It was my job to help come up with cool, interesting ideas and concepts for the game and how they would be designed and implemented into game. 
						Alongside this I was co-programmer for the game, I was tasked with programming the aforementioned design ideas and gameplay mechanics into the build and making sure they were implemented correctly and efficiently. 

					<p>We were able to show off our concept for the game at Dare To be Digital 2016, where we showed the public a small teaser trailer and screenshots of the game.

						Unfortunately due to university commitments and lack of time, the project was cancelled and the team went their separate ways. However I learned a great amount from this project, such as time management, a better understanding of source control and what to look out for in the future when developing an indie game.
