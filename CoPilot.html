		Microsoft's "Co-Pilot" mode which was released in a patch for the console, "Xbox One" (Microsoft Corporation, 2017) allows for the re-mapping of a games controls to multiple controllers, 
		allowing for multiple players to control a game simultaneously. 
		For example allowing one player to move the character of a game while another controls the interactions. 
		This feature is predominantly used for the use of helping players overcome challenges they cannot solve themselves, 
		for example if a younger player is having difficulties with an in-game puzzle; another player can take the controls and complete the challenge for them.

		This however is not the only use for "Co-Pilot" mode as there is great potential for the technology to be further utilized as a means of creating new and interesting local cooperative multiplayer experiences. As mentioned in the web series "Extra Credits" (Extra Credits, 2017), mapping the controls of a game to multiple controllers in concept is a brilliant idea when playing with a younger player as it allows them a chance to play, however also stated is that this method of control would not be very usable and would result in performing more poorly at the game as opposed to playing alone.
		Control schemes by nature must be intuitive and simple to understand in order for a player to not get confused and frustrated with the game. The research paper Measuring the Impact of Game Controllers on Player Experience in FPS Games (Gerling et al, 2011) explores this problem by getting participants to play a First Person Shooter game using both a mouse and keyboard and a PlayStation 3 controller. Both player experience and game usability issues were compared when using both control schemes. Although participants stated that they felt more challenged by the game if they were not using their preferred control scheme, they also showed positive reactions towards the game which remained high during play sessions. As the paper states, this suggests that if a certain level of usability is kept, a change of controls does not lead to a significant decrease in a players experience of the game. 
		This is a key point towards the use of "Co-Pilot" mode in a cooperative local multiplayer game. If the control scheme can be used and created in such a way that is both non-intrusive and maintains a level of usability, it can lead to fun and exciting local multiplayer experiences.
