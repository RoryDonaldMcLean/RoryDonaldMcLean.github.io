		<b>My Role</b>
		</br>
		--Co-Programmer.
		</br>
		--Gameplay Mechanics Creation.
		</br>
		--Game Design/ Mechanics Design.
		</br>
		For this small GameJam project, my key roles were the inital creation of the games main mechanic.
		</br>
		Which is clicking on an object to start it's "infection", checking what objects it is next to and "infecting" them to cause
		</br>
		a chain reaction in the hopes of infecting the entire levels organic and technological objects.
		
		
		
		</p>
	
	
	
	
		<p> 
		<b>About the Project</b>
		</br>
		Created In Unity Game Engine.
		</br>
		Coded in C#
		</br>
		Side Project: Undertaken during the 2018 Global GameJam.
		<p>
		As part of the Global Game Jam 2018, I took part as a programmer and game designer in a small team of fellow Abertay Master's Students to create a small Puzzle game based around the theme of "Transmission". 
		We created a small game called "Terminal Transmission" where the goal is to infect a building complex with a "techno-organic virus" by transmitting it either to a piece of technology or a human. 
		Once you do this the virus will chain-infect anything close by to the infected object. The goal is to time your initial infection so you can infect the largest number of objects possible.

	 <h2>About The Game</h2>
	 
	 <div id="AboutMe">
	 
	<p> TorchLighters Inc. is a top down 2D Dungeon exploration game, where you play as a Janitor cleaning up dungeons after pesky adventurers. TEST

				Dash, mop and clean your way through traps, monsters and fallen adventurers as you re-set the dungeon as fast as you can in this fun, fast paced speed run dungeon adventure! 
				I was one of two programmers that worked on this game as part of my Masters course at Abertay University. 
				This project was part of DARE; as a prize for one of the participants, they won the opportunity to see their game design idea realized as a game, I was part of the team that took on this challenge. 

				My key role was the creation of the games various traps for the player to interact with. Ensuring that the player can reset the traps, be killed by them and interact with them correctly. 
				Alongside this I helped with various game design aspects of the game such as how the player should navigate around the stage (dashing, speed run type movement) to level design (placements of traps, flow of the levels).
