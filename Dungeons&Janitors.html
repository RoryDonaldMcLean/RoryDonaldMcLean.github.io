    	<p> TorchLighters Inc. is a top down 2D Dungeon exploration game, where you play as a Janitor cleaning up dungeons after pesky adventurers. 

				Dash, mop and clean your way through traps, monsters and fallen adventurers as you re-set the dungeon as fast as you can in this fun, fast paced speed run dungeon adventure! 
				I was one of two programmers that worked on this game as part of my Masters course at Abertay University. 
				This project was part of DARE; as a prize for one of the participants, they won the opportunity to see their game design idea realized as a game, I was part of the team that took on this challenge. 

				My key role was the creation of the games various traps for the player to interact with. Ensuring that the player can reset the traps, be killed by them and interact with them correctly. 
				Alongside this I helped with various game design aspects of the game such as how the player should navigate around the stage (dashing, speed run type movement) to level design (placements of traps, flow of the levels).
