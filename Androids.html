		<b>About the Project</b>
		</br>
		Created in Unity Game Engine.
		</br>
		Coded in c#
		</br>
		University Project: Undertaken during Masters Course.
		</br>
		<p>
		Androids in a Lonely World is a cooperative local multiplayer puzzle game which was developed as part of my final term at Abertay University's Masters course. 
		The brief of the project which was given by Arron Simpson- Lead artist at Riot Games. The breif was a cooperative multiplayer game with a narrative that would
		help form an emotional connection between the two players. This was done by creating a simple puzzle game where both players control a pair of robots which have
		to exchange parts in order to navigate the enviroment and pick up and move puzzle elements. As the game progressed the Robots would slowly begin to fall apart
		forcing the players to cooperate and exchange more of their parts in order to progress.

	 <h2>About The Game</h2>
	 
	 <div id="AboutMe">
	 
	<p> TorchLighters Inc. is a top down 2D Dungeon exploration game, where you play as a Janitor cleaning up dungeons after pesky adventurers. TEST

				Dash, mop and clean your way through traps, monsters and fallen adventurers as you re-set the dungeon as fast as you can in this fun, fast paced speed run dungeon adventure! 
				I was one of two programmers that worked on this game as part of my Masters course at Abertay University. 
				This project was part of DARE; as a prize for one of the participants, they won the opportunity to see their game design idea realized as a game, I was part of the team that took on this challenge. 

				My key role was the creation of the games various traps for the player to interact with. Ensuring that the player can reset the traps, be killed by them and interact with them correctly. 
				Alongside this I helped with various game design aspects of the game such as how the player should navigate around the stage (dashing, speed run type movement) to level design (placements of traps, flow of the levels).
