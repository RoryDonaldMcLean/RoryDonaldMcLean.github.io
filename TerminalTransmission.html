					 <p> As part of the Global Game Jam 2018, I took part as a programmer and game designer in a small team of fellow Abertay Master's Students to create a small Puzzle game based around the theme of "Transmission". 
					 We created a small game called "B!O-HACKER: Jamsmissions" where the goal is to infect a building complex with a "techno-organic virus" by transmitting it either to a piece of technology or a human. 
					 Once you do this the virus will chain-infect anything close by to the infected object. The goal is to time your initial infection so you can infect the largest number of objects possible.
