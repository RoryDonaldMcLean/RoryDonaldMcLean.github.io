		This paper discusses and explores what is known as a Cycle of Tension and Release, 
		and how they are used in Horror and Action games. We have looked at what exactly is Tension and Release, 
		how to recognise when this cycle is being used and also each game's mechanics and aesthetics to see how they are used to enhance a cycle of Tension and Release and to what effect on a player. 
		Alongside this, this paper has explored the different aspects of this cycle such as the nature of a threat to the player, 
		vulnerability and nature of failure and how they are used to enhance this cycle.

		<p>Game Designers have been using various methods and techniques to keep their audience engaged and entertained when playing video games. 
		One such tool is known as the Cycle of Tension and Release. This is a method of raising the tension the player experiences when playing to help raise the player's stress levels, 
		excitement, anticipation or even fear in cases of Horror games. 
		And finally releasing that tension at critical parts of the game to give off an effect such as relaxation and time to prepare or shock and panic depending on the desired effect. 
		This paper will examine this Cycle of Tension and Release in both Horror games and Action games. 
		Exploring how this cycle is used differently in each genre and to what effect. 
		Alongside this, different aspects of this cycle will be explored such as the nature of the player feeling vulnerable, 
		nature of a threat to the player and the aesthetics of each genera and how it helps with the game's cycle of Tension and Release.</p>
